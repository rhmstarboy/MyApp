How to Participate in the Sunder Protocol Airdrop
Follow these steps to participate in the Sunder Protocol airdrop and maximize your chances of receiving SUNDER tokens:

Visit Sunder Protocol website and connect your wallet (preferably Rabby or another EVM-compatible wallet).
Acquire HYPE tokens from Hyperliquid, as you’ll need them to interact with the protocol. HYPE is the native token of the Hyperliquid ecosystem.
Transfer HYPE to HyperEVM by following the bridge instructions on the Hyperliquid platform.
Swap HYPE to WHYPE and/or SUNDER on the Sunder Protocol interface. WHYPE is the wrapped version of HYPE that’s used within the Sunder ecosystem.
Perform regular swaps between these tokens to earn points. Consistent activity is likely to be rewarded more than one-time large transactions.
Provide liquidity to the WHYPE/SUNDER pool to earn additional points:
Navigate to the “Pool” section
Select the WHYPE/SUNDER pair
Enter the amount you wish to provide
Confirm the transaction
Lock SUNDER tokens to create a veSUNDER position:
Go to the “Lock” section
Enter the amount of SUNDER tokens you want to lock
Choose your lock time (longer periods typically yield more voting power)
Click “Create” and confirm the transaction in your wallet
Participate in governance voting:
Navigate to the “Vote” section
Enter 100% under “Vote %” for the WHYPE/SUNDER pool
Click “Cast Vote” and confirm the transaction
